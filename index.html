                    <h1>What is Git?</h1>
                    <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With 
                    creation of each snapshot you build out a whoe application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can 
                    make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.
                    <h1 class="line-spacing">What is GitHub?</h1>
                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects 
                    from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took durin development.</p>

                        <h2>Git init</h2>
                        <p><span>git init</span> is the act of registering this current code base.</p>

                    <div class="three-blocks">
                            <h2>Git add</h2>
                            <p><span>Git add</span> is how we stage the intergration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="three-blocks">
                        <h2>Git status</h2>
                        <p><span>Git status</span> allows us to see the changes we are going to make</p>

                            <p><span>Git commit</span> ; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot 
                            of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>
                    </div>

                            <p><span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of our current code. This is 
                            where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                            <p><span>Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers
                            might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our
                            code base with features they wanted to add</p>
